# v4.0.0

Example Storefront v4.0.0 adds major features and performance enhancements, and does contain breaking changes since v3.1.0

_This is a reminder that starting with v3.x, all Reaction projects have begun tracking their versions independently, and this release **will** work with the latest releases of all other Reaction projects, even though the major version number may be different._

## BREAKING CHANGES

- React hooks are introduced, and replace many HOC's, which have been removed: `withAddressBook`, `withAddressValidation`, `withAvailablePaymentMethods`, `withCart`, `withCatalogItemProduct`, `withOrder`, `withOrders`, `withShop`, `withTag`, `withViewer`.
- Use React hooks for various parts of the application including orders, cart, shop, translations and more. This refactor remove various HOC that added unnecessary complexity to the app.
- MobX has been removed, and React context is now used in its place.
- Next.js has been update to use version 9.4.1, which includes support for [SSG](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#next-gen-static-site-generation-ssg-support)(Static Site Generation). By default product pages are re-regenerated every two minutes. Further, various other features, such as dynamic routes and API routes are now used, either a dynamic route or API.
- Various components from the Reaction component library have been removed in favor of using the new Reaction Catalyst design system. This is a stepping stone towards consolidating styling solutions use use only one.

## Refactors

- refactor: Storefront v2 ([#667](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront/pull/667))
- refactor: Revalidate index page, require instant revalidation if no shop is present during build ([#698](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront/pull/698))

- refactor: Use CANONICAL_URL for sitemap route ([#690](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront/pull/690))

## Fixes

# v2.0.0

Reaction v2.0.0—an API-first, real-time commerce engine built using Node.js, React, and GraphQL. It’s the second major release of our open source commerce software.

This release is coordinated with [Reaction Platform](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-platform) and is designed to work with the [Reaction](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction) and [reaction-hydra](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-hydra).

Reaction v2.0.0 is built as a truly headless commerce platform that decouples the Reaction backend services from the frontend. We’ve decoupled the storefront application from the API. Reaction platform now consists of this [Example Storefront](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront), which connects with the Reaction application via GraphQL to provide a customer-facing storefront. The API is provided by the [Reaction](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction) project, which is now primarily our GraphQL API. The legacy integrated Meteor storefront is no longer part of the Reaction project.

### Notable changes
This Example Storefront is brand new for the 2.0 version of Reaction. Check out [previous release notes](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront/releases) from this project for details and associated issues and PRs.

See the release notes for the [Reaction project](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/releases) for more information about our 2.0 release.

### New documentation
See [this page](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-docs/releases/tag/v2.0.0) for a non-comprehensive list of new and updated docs.

Some highlights:
- A [Storefront UI Development guide](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/next/storefront-intro) answering "How do I build a storefront for Reaction or adapt my storefront to get its data from Reaction, without starting from an example app"
- Helpful info about [GraphQL Resolvers](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/graphql-resolvers-file-structure) and [extending GraphQL to add a field](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/how-to-extend-graphql-to-add-field)
- A guide for [“How To Extend the Product Schema”](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/how-to-extend-product)


### OS notes
**Support for Windows.**
`[reaction-platform](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-platform)` is not compatible with Windows and has not been fully tested on Windows at this time.

**MacOS and Linux are supported.**
Reaction will support development in a dockerized environment and will focus on tooling and documentation for installation and configuration on the macOS and Linux OSes.

### We've adopted the DCO
We've adopted the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) in lieu of a Contributor License Agreement for all contributions to Reaction Commerce open source projects. We request that contributors agree to the terms of the DCO and indicate that agreement by signing all commits made to Reaction Commerce projects by adding a line with your name and email address to every Git commit message contributed:
```

```

You can sign your commit automatically with Git by using `git commit -s` if you have your `user.name` and `user.email` set as part of your Git configuration.

We ask that you use your real name (please no anonymous contributions or pseudonyms). By signing your commit you are certifying that you have the right have the right to submit it under the open source license used by that particular Reaction Commerce project. You must use your real name (no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions are allowed.)

We use the [Probot DCO GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/dco) to check for DCO signoffs of every commit. If you forget to sign your commits, the DCO bot will remind you and give you detailed instructions for how to amend your commits to add a signature.

We're following in the footsteps of several other open source projects in adopting the DCO such as [Chef](https://blog.chef.io/2016/09/19/introducing-developer-certificate-of-origin/), [Docker](https://blog.docker.com/2014/01/docker-code-contributions-require-developer-certificate-of-origin/), and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/11/01/gitlab-switches-to-dco-license/)

# v2.0.0-rc.12
This is our fourth release candidate for this project. While this project is technically still `pre-release` until we've released the final 2.0.0 version, it's the most stable version of Reaction Commerce, and we recommend starting new projects with it at this point. See https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront/issues/487#issuecomment-507468894 for more detail on this.

This version should be used with `v2.0.0-rc.12` of https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction

## Highlights
We have [renamed](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront/pull/544) this project from `reaction-next-starterkit` to `example-storefront` to better convey the intent behind our creating it.  We’re also [updating our docs](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-docs/pull/829) to clarify this change.

The GraphQL API in [reaction v2.0.0-rc.12](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5259) has been changed from `/graphql-alpha` to `graphql-beta` to indicate the increased stability of the API. We think there are still some breaking changes to come in the next 3-6 months to the GraphQL API which is why we're keeping the `-beta` suffix for now. As you find bugs with that API, please file issues in the [reaction](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues) repo.

# v2.0.0-rc.10

This is our second release candidate for this project. This project should be considered `pre-release` until we've released the final 2.0.0 version.

This version should be used with `v2.0.0-rc.10` of https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction

# Improvements

### Dev Utilities

- We have made it easier to debug and troubleshoot issues in our Docker image:
  (#504)

### General

- We added a new new profile address book page (#499)
- We added support for GraphQL Subscriptions (#492)
- We added the ability to get sitemap data from GQL API and make it available on sitemap\*.xml routes (#488)
- We added the ability to have surcharges attached to an order (#499)

# Breaking Changes

### Multiple Payment Support

- All of the individual `placeOrder*` GraphQL mutations provided by the built-in payment plugins are removed and replaced with a single `placeOrder` mutation which supports multiple payments. Any custom payment method plugins will break due to the removal of `createOrder` internal mutation. Look at all changes. (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4908)
